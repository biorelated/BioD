# BioD [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/biod/BioD.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/biod/BioD) [![DUB Package](https://img.shields.io/badge/dub-v0.1.0-red.svg)](https://code.dlang.org/packages/biod)

[BioD](https://github.com/biod/BioD) is a fast and memory efficient bioinformatics library written in the [D programming language](http://www.dlang.org)
whose aim is to:

* Provide a platform for developing high-performance computational biology applications using the [D programming language](http://www.dlang.org) through
  - Automatic parallelization of tasks where possible
  - Avoiding unnecessary memory allocations

## Why BioD?

BioD leverages on [D programming language](http://www.dlang.org)
features to develop high performance bioinformatics tools
(e.g. [sambamba](https://github.com/biod/sambamba)). The D programming
language is both a low and high-level hybrid object orientated and
functional (OOP/FP) programming language with templating/generic
features are far easier than that of C++.

## D programming language resources

* [Programming in D](http://ddili.org/ders/d.en/index.html) is online by Ali Ã‡ehreli.
* [The D Programming Language](https://www.amazon.com/D-Programming-Language-Andrei-Alexandrescu/dp/0321635361) by Andrei Alexandrecu (great book, slightly out of date)
* [The D Cookbook](https://www.amazon.com/D-Cookbook-Adam-D-Ruppe/dp/1783287217) by Adam D. Ruppe

## Current development

Our aim is to provide a set of D modules to manipulate and work with
biological datasets.  BioD provides modules for manipulating high
throughput data formats by provifing fast and easy to use native BAM
file reader and writer with ability to iterate a BAM file a read at a
time,a nucleotide at a time (pileup) or via a sliding window.


## Install

The current default is to provide the path to the checked out repo to
the D-compiler. For example,

    DFLAGS = -wi -I. -IBioD -g

## Build environment

After installing ldc and dub

    dub
    dub test

It is possible to create a recent build container with the
[GNU guix](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/) transactional package
manager

    guix environment -C guix --ad-hoc ldc dub zlib gdb binutils-gold --network

after getting dropped in the container simply run dub.

If you want to use the make file instead (not requiring the network) use

    guix environment -C guix --ad-hoc ldc zlib gdb make binutils-gold --no-grafts
    make -j 4
    make check

## Debugging

When using gdb, switch off these handlers

`handle SIGUSR1 SIGUSR2 nostop noprint`

It can be passed in from the command line

`gdb -iex "handle SIGUSR1 SIGUSR2 no stop noprint" biod_test`
